# TheMovieDB ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/iOS-13.0-brightgreen)

A iOS Application that shows up the movies by consuming the [TheMovieDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

## Description
Using the MVC architecture with the Network Service, we create this project to learn more about the Objective-C and its features, and that's why the app was build with no pods at all; **free from dependencies**.

We also have the bold to link the Objective-C with the Swift: the backend (such as the data fetched, the frameworks and libraries) was made in Objective-C and the frontend(the tableview, cells and outlets) were made in Swift.
